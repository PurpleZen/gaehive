    <h1 class="greeting">Us & Scratch Guidelines</h1>
    <span><b>The Gaehive Website is a website created by me, Scratch user <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/LegoManiac04" target="_blank">LegoManiac04</a> (hello!)<br>I created this website as a sort of companion to a studio called the Gaehive, also known as "The LGBTQ+ Studio." I wanted to create a site that could host some fun and useful tools for this studio!</b><br></span><div class="break"></div><span>Since I wanted to share this website on Scratch, I knew I needed to make sure this site followed Scratch Community Guidelines. With that, I knew I had to approach the Hivezine (a news/blog-like feature) differently. When creating a post for the Hivezine, users can write a draft on this website. This allows them to see a preview of what their post will look like. However, whatever they type won't directly be posted, as that would break Community Guidelines. Instead, users will copy their draft and paste it into <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33586934/comments" target="_blank">this studio</a>. They then return to this site, click a button, and it will fetch their comment from the studio and save it onto our database. By doing this, all Hivezine posts are posted on Scratch, and therefore are run through Scratch's filter.<br><br>Similarly on our "Managers" page, users can add and remove users from the host queue. When a user is added, it is verified whether that Scratch account exists or not. That means that a user would not be able to add an inappropriate user to the queue, as the Scratch filter would not allow such a user to exist. Plus, only the listed managers can add more managers. Like the Hivezine, the About Me/Bio section on each manager is posted in !!!!THIS!!!! studio, and is then fetched and saved here.<br><br>Likewise with the "Birthdays" page, only managers and a few other trusted users are in charge of inputing users, whose accounts, similar to the managers, are verified to exist. With the birthdays, only users who request to be added to the calendar in <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/34421126/comments" target="_blank">this studio</a> will be added. We do not ask for or collect birthyears, only the month and day, and only if a users <i>asks/requests</i> to be added. This feature was made as we like celebrating users' birthdays in the Scratch Studio, and having a calendar like this allows us to recognize and celebrate more users, and easily! We had birthday calendar studio before, so I though making this feature would be useful.<br></span><div class="break"></div><span>Furthermore, I don't want just anybody to be able to write Hivezine posts, or change the order of the host queue. To prevent this, users will log in through <a href="https://auth.itinerary.eu.org/" target="_blank">Scratch Auth</a>, which is a website created by Scratch user <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Looky1173" target="_blank">Looky1173</a> that allows users to log into sites using Cloud Data in Scratch projects or with comments. Many Scratcher-created sites use Scratch Auth, such as <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/Jeffalo" target="_blank">Jeffalo</a>'s <a href="https://ocular.jeffalo.net" target="_blank">Ocular forum search</a>. You can find more information about Scratch Auth <a href="https://auth.itinerary.eu.org/documentation/using-scratch-auth" target="_blank">here</a>.<br>To put it simply, users must be logged in to do anything on this site, and when a logged in user tries to do something like add a Hivezine post, their login token is verified.<br>To give certain users permissions, their usernames are stored on the website's database. For example, all users that appear in the host queue are stored on the database, and only those users have permission to alter the host queue. These permissions are encrypted in the user's login token, and are stored on the database, so absolutely only these users have permission to do these actions.<br><br>Regardless of permissions, all pages on this website are viewable by anyone! So no, there's no secret, unmoderated, private chat feature anywhere. If you're curious, you can view all pages <a href="https://github.com/PurpleZen/gaehive/tree/ver2/src" target="_blank">here in the site's source code</a>.<br><br>For any Scratch Team members reading this, I hope that you can see and understand that I take making this website follow the Scratch Community Guidelines seriously, and that this has provided clarification if you were looking for it. I want this site to offer some fun and useful tools, but I also want to make sure all users are safe.<br><br>Thank you so very much for taking the time to read through this! ❤️</span>
