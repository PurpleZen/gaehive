Now Marcel lives with only his Grandma in a house that is an Air B&amp;B. None of the guests notice Marcel - until an amateur film maker comes along, and decides to make a documentary about Marcel.  You get to see Marcel living everyday parts of his life, telling stories, and eventually looking for his family. I really enjoyed the style of the movie, which is modeled as a sort of documentary, but also includes stop motion and puppetry in order to bring Marcel and other characters to life. &lt;br&gt; The movie is rated PG, is 1.5 hours long, and you can find where to watch it   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=watch+marcel+the+shell+with+shoes+on&amp;rlz=1CAMFAZ_enUS986US986&amp;oq=mar&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j69i64j69i59j69i61j69i60j69i61.1161j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;si=ACFMAn_SS78MEibKCAWlYss0xRJ_xMTuplOxPXIKGH46gujQMmuDAhq317pRSSPzNWK7hYIKWRpvIKVsolWRI6dZzfQjHUslrlioeZBDQMl66i2Y2nOG_iI1PzO0kfsUVGlK9ohC_9D-ek7YbSQVs1TO5xdAWoBfVqlaxa4_WaTuLSeolsrRb4hwOlhhYCJhujqedkHzaoTj&amp;ictx=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi175aqgKGBAxVBj4kEHcsDDBAQyNoBKAB6BAgREAA&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;   &lt;h4&gt; tldr : Y&apos;all should really watch this movie it&apos;s super good and really wholesome &lt;/h4&gt; ","pid":234245745,"id":149,"like":4,"likeby":["alwaysmefor","flying-away","-Lotus-Eater-","LegoManiac04"],"love":4,"loveby":["F1nn_on_paws","Idi0t-Genius","kindadelulu","-Lotus-Eater-"]},{"user":"lesbiandragons","uid":98324295,"date":"September 10, 2023","title":"testing (for real this time)","post":"i bet my mom would drink this &lt;br&gt; :pumpkin_spice_latte:","pid":234161549,"id":148,"laugh":1,"laughby":["LegoManiac04"],"love":2,"loveby":["Im_Anominous","kindadelulu"],"wow":2,"wowby":["Idi0t-Genius","coral4444"],"sad":1,"sadby":["alwaysmefor"],"like":1,"likeby":["Im_Anominous"]},{"user":"LegoManiac04","uid":21629747,"date":"September 10, 2023","title":":pumpkin: Fall Emoji Update! :boo!:","post":"With fall just around the corner, I thought it would be a good time to update the compatible emojis here on the Hivezine to add some Fall and Halloween spirit!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This update adds: &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;:leaves&zwj;: - :leaves:&lt;li&gt;:pumpkin&zwj;: - :pumpkin:&lt;li&gt;:boo!&zwj;: - :boo!:&lt;li&gt;:bat&zwj;: - :bat:&lt;/ul&gt;And of course...&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;:pumpkin_spice_latte&zwj;:&lt;br&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;try it hehe&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Hope you enjoy! :happy:","pid":234160329,"id":146,"yay":5,"yayby":["embXR_THEauthZr","flying-away","coral4444","kindadelulu","dustbyte"],"sad":1,"sadby":["lesbiandragons"],"like":2,"likeby":["Im_Anominous","-Lotus-Eater-"],"wow":1,"wowby":["alwaysmefor"],"love":1,"loveby":["Idi0t-Genius"]},{"user":"LegoManiac04","uid":21629747,"date":"September 1, 2023","title":"Website Survey","post":"I want to collect a bit of a survey about the Gaehive website, as I will be refreshing things and releasing a major update probably next year or so. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Really I have three questions: &lt;br&gt;1.)

Of course, all posts are posted on Scratch, so they have to pass through Scratch&apos;s filter, however, if there is a post that you, as a Writer or Manager, feel breaks Scratch or Gaehive Guidelines, please delete the post by clicking the title of the post, and clicking the small delete button in the top right. If it breaks Community Guidelines, make sure you report the comment, which you can find in &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33586934/comments&quot;&gt;this studio&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&apos;re neither a Writer or a Manager, I&apos;d encourage you to reach out to one if you feel a post does not belong here.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I also leave it up to you Writers, and especially Managers, whether a Writer is no longer fit for the position. If you feel a Writer should be removed, please do so by clicking the &quot;Edit Writers&quot; button on the Hivezine homepage. Once their login expires two weeks after their most recent login, they will lose Hivezine access.&lt;br&gt; If there are any users who you think would make a great Writer, you can also add them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Home page:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Writers and Managers can pin posts to the homepage by clicking on the post and clicking the small pin button in the top right. Please only pin posts if they are important studio news or announcements!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Manager page:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;The managers page is pretty straightforward;  If we promote new managers, or a current one leaves/becomes inactive, you Managers can add and remove them by clicking the &quot;Edit Managers&quot; button.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Overall:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please leave any feedback, questions, ideas, or bug reports by clicking the &quot;feedback&quot; button on the sidebar.

This is a lil series I&apos;m starting for Hivezine. It&apos;s like a Gaehive AU where the Hive is a camp, managers are counselors, and profiles are bunks.  If you feel uncomfortable with being featured in it or would like me to take out a line, please contact me on any of my projects or studio on Scratch. I will try to get around to putting every one in! [only if you want to be in it]! :frog: :cool: :happy: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Part 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n &quot;I suppose I should have anticipated that,&quot; I grumble. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yes, you should have,&quot; says Pearl, my cabinmate, pouring the remainder of the bucket of water that they just dumped on my head out the window. &quot;You didn&apos;t wake up at the bell, so I figured I&apos;d give you a nudge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Thanks for that,&quot; I reply, pushing myself out of bed. Camp Gaehive has everything a gae could ever wish for- but it&apos;s lacking in the sleep department. That might be at least partially my cabinmate&apos;s fault.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I brush through my short pink hair and tie it under an ace flag bandana. I assemble my backpack for the day as Pearl goes around to wake up the rest of our campsite. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There are eight campsites in Camp Gaehive - one for each manager. Pearl and I are in Campsite 6, or Chaos, and it&apos;s under Brook.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I look at my watch, then turn to Pearl. &quot;It&apos;s 6:15, we have and hour and fifteen minutes until breakfast. I&apos;m going to teach you how to sail.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;To what?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;To sail. You know, like on a boat?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Yeah, I know,&quot; Pearl replies. &quot;You know how to sail? And are there sailboats here?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Camp Gaehive is purely hypothetical, so yes. With a progressive pride flag sail.  Because I said so.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only a true friend would get their best friend up in the morning, drag them all the way down to the hypothetical Lake Althive, rig a boat, and push the two of them out to sea in it with no warning.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So that, of course, is what I did. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;What&apos;s the point of this, exactly?&quot; Pearl asked, pulling garlic bread out of their overalls and taking a bite.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I&apos;m going to teach &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; how to sail,&quot; I replied, cleating a rope. &quot;Here, sit where I&apos;m sitting, and push on this rod. It&apos;s called the tiller.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Confession time: I&apos;m a terrible teacher.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pearl pushed the stick towards himself. &quot;Wait, no!&quot; I yelled too late. &quot;That&apos;s a jibe! &quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The hypothetical boat turned violently, and a riptide cut through the nonexistant lake. The boat keeled, leaving Pearl almost completely in the water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I looked down on them. &quot;Never, in your entire life, do what I&apos;m about to do,&quot; I advised. Then, I grabbed a rope in my teeth, unhooked another with my toes, extended my leg to grab Pearl, and tried to steer until we faced straight into the wind, our sail taking us nowhere.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Did I mention I&apos;m a pessimist?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So as I pulled Pearl up, of course my thoughts were &quot;What&apos;s the worst that can happen?&quot; followed by thinking about the worst that could happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In a hypothetical world in which outcomes are based on the imagination, that is very dangerous.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The boat turned rapidly towards the far shore of Lake Althive, which I&apos;d never seen, partially because, you know, it didn&apos;t really exist.  The boat pierced into the glittery rainbow shore, tipped over on land, and sent the two of us rolling down the rainbow, sticky, mud-covered hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pearl regained their footing first, and helped me up.   We both looked like we had been doused in liquid opals. It became clear that the clumpy, iridescant mud was not coming off. Pearl looked at their watch. &quot;We have fifteen minutes to get back to Chaos,&quot; they said.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&bull;&bull;&bull;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we got back to Chaos, everyone was already awake and waiting for us. &quot;No one saw them leave,&quot; Brook confirmed.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &quot;Nope,&quot; said Lucifer, not looking up from his Pjsekai game.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Brook groaned. &quot;They&apos;re gonna make us late!&quot; they turned. &quot;Oh, hi guys!&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They glanced at our iridescent mud-covered figures. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;His fault,&quot; said Pearl, pointing at me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;True,&quot; I said. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you all about it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Maybe take a shower first?&quot; Brook suggested.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Deal.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;End. Hope you enjoyed! I didn&apos;t!

It&apos;s a very common identity with a lot of culture behind it, and that culture goes hand and hand with the flag, which has changed a lot over the past 25 years. Here&apos;s a timeline of the lesbian flag, then to now!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;:pride:1999:pride:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://imgbb.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/GQ6pLFK/Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-54-12-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-54-12-AM&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  The first recorded lesbian flag was made in 1999 by Sean Campbell, a gay artist. It looks completely different from the modern lesbian pride flags. Called the Labrys flag after the axe, it was centered around symbolism in shapes rather than color, most notably the black triangle that represents feminism and lesbianism. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Labrys Lesbian pride flag died a very quick death. Many lesbians were averse to the idea of using a pride flag that was made by a man. Additionally, the black triangle is a reclaimed symbol from Nazi Germany, who categorized certain people (including lesbians) with a black triangle. It was also adopted by TERF&apos;s and the anti-butch, so it was mostly deserted. In the early 2010s, a new, possibly more controversial flag surfaced.&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;:pride:2010:pride:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://ibb.co/SJhJn1s&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/M9Y9Vj2/Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-54-35-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-54-35-AM&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/center&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The lipstick lesbian pride flag is still sometimes used today. It was made by  Natalie McCray and was the main lesbian flag for about a decade. Known as the &quot;lipstick lesbian&quot; or &quot;pink lesbian&quot; flag, it was almost if not entirely exclusively representing &quot;femme&quot; lesbians, and ones who fit a very specific idea of lesbian femininity. This did not sit well with other lesbians, and for this reason, it stopped being the socially acceptable lesbian pride flag. &lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;:pride:2018:pride:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgbb.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/hdwPwDN/Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-55-37-AM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-11-55-37-AM&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://imgbb.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ibb.co/9nKKT4m/Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-12-03-12-PM.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screen-Shot-2023-08-07-at-12-03-12-PM&quot; border=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/center&gt; A nonbinary lesbian named Emily Gwen created the sunset lesbian flag in 2018. It is, to this day, the most widely used lesbian flag. Each of its 7 colors has a meaning to the entire lesbian community, including colors representing gender nonconformity and a unique relationship to womanhood. You&apos;ll more commonly see the 5-color version of this flag, which is just a simplified version for easier use in design. They&apos;re both considered valid versions of the sunset lesbian flag.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;br&gt;:pride:Ending Notes:pride:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;br&gt;After almost 25 years, there is still no official lesbian flag. In addition to the mainstream flags discussed in this article, there are also a few other flags, including the sun lesbian and moon lesbian flags, ones made for specific use by nonbinary or trans lesbians, and others.  Queer flags are about as straightforward as the communities they represent (which is to say- they&apos;re not) so always make sure to ask questions about a flag before using it and be respectful to the rest of your community!

But as soon as I walked through my bedroom door, I think I blacked out?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Maybe I was just very tired and fell asleep on the spot, and now I&apos;m dreaming? I don&apos;t think I felt tired, and this feels too clear to be a dream. Maybe there was some sort of freak accident, and I died before I could even process it? Is this the afterlife? No, no, that&apos;s just absurd. But what I do know is that this certainly not where I just was.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I think I saw an anime sort of like this once at the video rental place the other day, but that&apos;s besides the point.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The ground here is... powdery? It&apos;s not snow, and I don&apos;t think it&apos;s sand or dirt either. It&apos;s cold, but it&apos;s not freezing, and it&apos;s a very sparkly white. It feels nice to sift through my batty wing membrane, too. And the trees, where to start with the trees... They&apos;re like pine trees, but their needles are bright red, and they have a subtle glow to them. Certainly from the floating glowing jellyfish hovering about the place. Did I mention the jellyfish? They&apos;re almost mesmerizing to look at...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m so confused as to where I am and what&apos;s going on, but I can&apos;t help but appreciate the peaceful energy this place has.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No, no, no... Beautiful as it is, I can&apos;t stick around. I think first and foremost, I need to find a way home. Somehow. I&apos;m not sure where to start, though... I suppose I have no choice but to wander around and see if I can get anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;After a bit of walking, I found something. It&apos;s a stone plaque of some sort, but it looks like it hasn&apos;t been touched in ages... Wiping off some of the sparkly dust, I can make out what it says:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Under starlight, a gentle breeze; a realm beyond what your mind can comprehend. To those who slipped through reality&apos;s seams: Welcome home.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;What that implies, I&apos;m not sure. But I have a bad feeling in my stomach.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Deep breaths... It&apos;ll be okay, I think.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;There&apos;s a wooden dock on the edge of the river here, too. Looking out between the cliffs the river carves through, I can see what I can only assume is a city, but it&apos;s clearly defying gravity... The buildings seem to be hanging upside-down.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But that does make me wonder, are there other people here? Like, people I can talk to? Or am I alone with the jellyfish for however long it takes for me to get out of here?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;* * *&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trees are getting denser, and that nasty feeling in my chest is rising again. Believe me, I&apos;m trying to stay calm and think about this rationally, but I&apos;m not sure if logical thinking will help me in this situation. I&apos;m still not entirely sure if this is real, or one very vivid hallucination.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I am incredibly relieved to have had my baseball bat on me when I ended up here, though. I&apos;m nervous, sure, but I think I&apos;d be even more of a wreck if I didn&apos;t have any sort of self-defense. Because you never know when something  might...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Sluuuuuuurp!&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I can feel my heart pumping absurdly fast now. Before I could even process the sound, a figure burst from the thick foliage! It&apos;s a grotesque creature reminicent of a mushroom, with a mouth filled with presumably hundreds of tiny jagged teeth. You know lampreys, those eel fish things with all those little teeth? It&apos;s like that, but on a huge, bulbous mushroom with a long sticky tongue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now, without warning, it&apos;s charging towards me! I&apos;m just barely able to react. I&apos;m scared stiff, but there&apos;s still enough adrenaline coursing through me to hold my bat in front of me like a knight guarding with a sword. The mushroom creature rams into it with a meaty &lt;em&gt;thump&lt;/em&gt;, and I&apos;m unharmed. I&apos;m on autopilot now--while it&apos;s recovering from the impact, I give it a big whack over the head. But it&apos;s not finished yet! It gets back up and begins to charge at me again, maw wide open, making disgusting slurping and slobbering sounds. I try to block it again, but it knows better this time. Instead of going straight towards me, it goes around and aims for my leg. And it bites down &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. But at this point I couldn&apos;t care less about the pain, or at least that&apos;s what I&apos;m trying to tell myself. I haven&apos;t lost all hope just yet... The mushroom, as painful as it is, is very light. I shake it off my leg, and while it&apos;s in midair, I impulsively try to whack it across the forest clearing like a baseball...&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gaehive.vercel.app/hivezine/post/43&quot;&gt;part 2 here!&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","id":44,"love":10,"loveby":["NebulaOfTheEarth","dancinqq-","lesbian-lucifer","ARCHlVED","holmes-aficionado","-arofluixity-","memorysauce","livid---liam","Moonwatcher127","LegoManiac04"],"yay":3,"yayby":["dancinqq-","dancinqq-","memorysauce"],"laugh":1,"laughby":["memorysauce"],"like":3,"likeby":["purple_cat_human_","--b-a-s-i-l--","memorysauce"],"wow":1,"wowby":["memorysauce"],"sad":1,"sadby":["lesbiandragons"]},{"user":"melody-sy","uid":108189592,"date":"August 7, 2023","title":"Mellie&apos;s Writing Corner 1 - Drifting (Part 2)","post":"&lt;p&gt;I missed. I&apos;m probably not cool enough to do something like that anyway. But with quick thinking, I continue the swing and spin around, hitting the mushroom away after it had landed on the ground. Oh yeah, that&apos;s improv for you! I knew practicing cool over-the-top fighting moves in my room when nobody was home was going to come in handy someday.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;At this point the mushroom creature is knocked out, I&apos;m sitting on the ground with my leg still in pain, and the clouds of sparkly dust we both kicked up are beginning to settle.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Wait! No, the mushroom monster is slowly getting back up! My adrenaline rush had already worn off, and I can&apos;t get on my feet for another round because of whatever burning juice that thing had on its teeth. It&apos;s now slowly trudging towards me, barely holding on but ready for one last attack to finish me off. And I think I&apos;m ready to accept my fate...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hey! Leave &apos;em alone, you rotten pizza topping!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;That voice, it sounds small and soft, and scratchy in a charming way. But as soon as I heard it, I had only one thought: people! I was starting to think this whole place was just crawling with killer beasts and creatures.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The mushroom froze in its tracks as well, like a criminal caught red-handed. It darted away without even a single slurp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The source of the voice walks in through the trees. I look at them for a moment. they&apos;re certainly not any type of anthropomorphic animal I recognize. They&apos;re short, with fuzzy fur split right down the middle in a half-white-half-black pattern, big ears, one big curly lock of hair, and no arms or wings or any sort of upper limbs in sight.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stars, what a weirdo.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I continue staring. Look, you may not know this about me, but I&apos;ve never been a really social person--talking to new people is hard. I don&apos;t really like my voice, anyway. But I&apos;m getting ahead of myself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Oh, not you. I mean the other guy.&quot; They gesture towards the direction the mushroom  monster ran off in. I awkwardly nod in understanding...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They walk closer and kneel down next to me, noticing that I&apos;ve been clutching my leg.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Are you alright? You&apos;re not hurt, are you?&quot; Their ears twitch a little bit. &quot;Here, let me have a look.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Hesitantly, I move my wings off of my leg, still burning from the acidic venom. I sure hope this isn&apos;t some monster trying to lower my guard and attack me where I&apos;m already weakened...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Yikes, that does look bad... Here, watch this.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;They pull out a sort of ribbon, and wrap it around my leg like a very frilly bandage. And now they&apos;re tying a bow over the wound using their hair like an arm, and... Huh?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;As soon as the bow is tied, the ribbon begins to glow and dissolve, crumbling into the same glimmering dust that&apos;s all over the ground. And sure enough, when the ribbon is gone, my leg&apos;s completely healed! I have to say, I&apos;m confused, but also kind of impressed at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fuzzy  creature kind of leans on my shoulder in a smug &quot;Cool, huh?&quot; sort of way.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Usually I&apos;d charge you for that, but I&apos;m sure my wallet wouldn&apos;t mind if I skipped that just this once.&quot; I can almost hear the playful snark in their voice... Seemingly brimming with energy, they dart over to a spot next to me and sit down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Anyway, my name&apos;s Zee!&quot; They pause, and switch back to the snarky voice. &quot;But you can call me Zed if you prefer.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I&apos;m not sure how to progress the conversation at this point. Talking isn&apos;t my strong suit. But I do manage to let out a shaky and quiet...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Hi.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Euegh, that came too blunt, too deep, too emotionless, I sound like a narrator for a serious documentary or something. Bad first impression! I pull my scarf over my mouth in shame, but Zee doesn&apos;t seem to notice.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;So what brings you to this quiet little corner of the Rift? Seeing other not-monsters is rare in this part of the Crystal Forest, you know.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rift? Crystal Forest? You can&apos;t just throw these words at me and expect me to understand, I just got here and I am lost and confused!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;I really don&apos;t want to talk again, though. I end up tilting my head at Zee like a confused dog.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Ah, you&apos;re... out of the loop.&quot; Zee seems lost in thought now... &quot;Ahh... ahhhh... Aha!&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Zee seems to have come to... Some sort of realization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;You&apos;re a Drifter, aren&apos;t you?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Drifter... I&apos;m not entirely sure what that means, but...&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I, well, I forgot how to explain it. But basically a Drifter is someone from outside the Rift, who is now in the Rift.&quot; Zee stumbles a bit, realizing too late they forgot an important detail... &quot;Um! The Rift is what we call this world, by the way.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is all so confusing... But at least I have some context, I guess?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m sorry, this must be a lot of trouble for you.&quot; Zee sighs and stands up. I shakily do the same. &quot;Tell you what, how about we get you somewhere safe, and then we can sort this out?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Zee gestures towards the other side of the clearing. &quot;There&apos;s a little town up ahead called Rift&apos;s Edge. I run the healing inn there, you know... Maybe It&apos;d be a good place to rest up?&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I brush the dust off of my knees. Zee seems eager to continue and is already moving forward, looking at me as if they expect me to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Either way, it&apos;s best we get going, before another monster comes out and kills both of us, or something! Come on!&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why do I feel as if I&apos;m not going home anytime soon?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #ff99cc;&quot;&gt;that&apos;s all for now! if you liked it you are welcome to tell me on my scratch profile :3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;","id":43,"love":8,"loveby":["NebulaOfTheEarth","ARCHlVED","-arofluixity-","memorysauce","livid---liam","Moonwatcher127","LegoManiac04","PrincessMeta"],"like":3,"likeby":["purple_cat_human_","--b-a-s-i-l--","memorysauce"],"laugh":1,"laughby":["memorysauce"],"yay":1,"yayby":["memorysauce"],"wow":1,"wowby":["memorysauce"],"sad":1,"sadby":["lesbiandragons"]},{"user":"LegoManiac04","uid":21629747,"date":"August 7, 2023","title":"POV: You were misbehaving in the Gaehive","post":"&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tenor.com/v8JBsczVfD4AAAAC/timeout.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://media.tenor.com/dZTWqVA0wjwAAAAd/shame-box.gif&quot;&gt;","id":31,"love":22,"loveby":["Amazing_Enby","TA-M01","IatetocIass","dancinqq-","lesbian-lucifer","MossIsQueer","-arofluixity-","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","-Lotus-Eater-","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","Moonwatcher127","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","HungarianHorntail7"],"laugh":19,"laughby":["Amazing_Enby","IatetocIass","lesbian-lucifer","NebulaOfTheEarth","LGBTQIAlex","peach_gummy","MossIsQueer","ARCHlVED","-arofluixity-","memorysauce","-Lotus-Eater-","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","iliveonthisplanet","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","Soaring-Jay"],"sad":12,"sadby":["lesbian-lucifer","IatetocIass","livid---liam","warrior1785","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ResilCarbon"],"yay":7,"yayby":["lesbian-lucifer","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow"],"like":16,"likeby":["coral4444","IatetocIass","dancinqq-","peach_gummy","MossIsQueer","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","memorysauce","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow"],"wow":9,"wowby":["MossIsQueer","lesbiandragons","ARandomNumberIs7482","K1TTYGVTS","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow","ICantCallNow"]},{"user":"IatetocIass","uid":117396787,"date":"August 7, 2023","title":"Policy Notice","post":"A new policy has been added to the description.

It was released on May 31, 2008, and has become one of the most well-known VOCALOID songs.&lt;br&gt; The song is about a girl who calls herself a &quot;princess.&quot; She sings about her struggles in trying to get a boy to notice her. She wants him to give her everything she wants. At the end of the song, he pulls her out of the path of an oncoming vehicle, thus completing her struggle.&lt;br&gt;I hope you enjoyed my first ever Hivezine article!
