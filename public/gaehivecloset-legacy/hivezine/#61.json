(I have other names and stuff but these are subject to change) My pronouns are they/he/xe and I am quite the queerio if i do say so myself :nails: . I enjoy writing poetry, reading, antiquing, comics, and drawing. I am flux between libramasc and agender. I am achillean. My Myers-Briggs personality type is INFP-T (or the meditator) and I am a cancer. I am also agnostic (god is just watching the world burn lol). I plan on posting fun science facts and poetry. Some of the comics i enjoy are: My dictator boyfriend (on webtoon), Heir&rsquo;s Game (on webtoon), Love from Beyond War (on webtoon) and the Adventures of God (on webtoon) these all have queer and disability representation and are medium and or light (depending on the comic) on swearing but i love them all. I also founded the Transmasc Locker Room (or TMLR) which is a very fun place, you should check it out https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/33606718/ . If you have questions about any of these things please ask on my profile page. Thanks for your time :)","id":61,"like":3,"likeby":["ARCHlVED","livid---liam","Soaring-Jay"],"sad":1,"sadby":["lesbiandragons"]}]
