[{"user":"coral4444","uid":41543836,"date":"September 10, 2023","title":"Movie Recommendation! - Marcel the Shell with Shoes On","post":" &lt;h3&gt; Marcel the Shell with Shoes on &lt;/h3&gt; This is a super cute movie about a 1-inch-tall shell named Marcel, and his journey to find the rest of his family. &lt;br&gt; Marcel used to live with a bunch of other members of a community, until one day they disappeared. Now Marcel lives with only his Grandma in a house that is an Air B&amp;B. None of the guests notice Marcel - until an amateur film maker comes along, and decides to make a documentary about Marcel.  You get to see Marcel living everyday parts of his life, telling stories, and eventually looking for his family. I really enjoyed the style of the movie, which is modeled as a sort of documentary, but also includes stop motion and puppetry in order to bring Marcel and other characters to life. &lt;br&gt; The movie is rated PG, is 1.5 hours long, and you can find where to watch it   &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com/search?q=watch+marcel+the+shell+with+shoes+on&amp;rlz=1CAMFAZ_enUS986US986&amp;oq=mar&amp;aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j69i59j69i64j69i59j69i61j69i60j69i61.1161j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;si=ACFMAn_SS78MEibKCAWlYss0xRJ_xMTuplOxPXIKGH46gujQMmuDAhq317pRSSPzNWK7hYIKWRpvIKVsolWRI6dZzfQjHUslrlioeZBDQMl66i2Y2nOG_iI1PzO0kfsUVGlK9ohC_9D-ek7YbSQVs1TO5xdAWoBfVqlaxa4_WaTuLSeolsrRb4hwOlhhYCJhujqedkHzaoTj&amp;ictx=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi175aqgKGBAxVBj4kEHcsDDBAQyNoBKAB6BAgREAA&quot;&gt; here &lt;/a&gt;   &lt;h4&gt; tldr : Y&apos;all should really watch this movie it&apos;s super good and really wholesome &lt;/h4&gt; ","pid":234245745,"id":149,"like":4,"likeby":["alwaysmefor","flying-away","-Lotus-Eater-","LegoManiac04"],"love":4,"loveby":["F1nn_on_paws","Idi0t-Genius","kindadelulu","-Lotus-Eater-"]}]
