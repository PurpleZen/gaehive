Just a sense of intrigue, I suppose.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;What do you think she&apos;s looking for?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;A way back to her old world, I assume.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Despite her initial curiosity, she seems uncomfortable with the truth of reality that must surely be dawning on her.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Perhaps she just needs time for it to settle in. Any sudden revalation of this scale would be frightening for a mortal like her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Her old world was rigid and unkind, but it was all she knew.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;The Rift has its demons, yes, but it is also a place of boundless freedom.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Once she comes to terms with the nature of the Rift, I believe she&apos;ll be truly happy.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;But the journey for her to get there will be difficult.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Yes, especially considering how... stubborn she is.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;Stubborn is not the word I&apos;d use, Pause.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I think she&apos;s just afraid.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;Yes. Afraid of change, and of the unfamiliar.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;It&apos;s easy for a mortal to be overwhelmed by the influx of possibilities that come with this sort of discovery.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;They question the world,  they question themselves, they question the arbitrary regulations that had kept their potential hidden.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;And for some who are still in denial, it can send them spiraling into madness in search of a way back to what they knew. A dangerous path, for sure.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Do you think we sould help this Drifter? Set her on the right track?&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I&apos;m not sure.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;I think we should not intervene. I feel that is not the solution here.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&quot;She&apos;s afraid, yes, but she&apos;s strong and open-minded as well. I have no doubts that she will sort it out.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;I hope so.&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&quot;I suppose we only have to wait and see where this goes.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;","id":65,"love":7,"loveby":["furbiez-0-clock","Ruby_Crystals","ARCHlVED","-Lotus-Eater-","Spacey_boy","LegoManiac04","Amazing_Enby"],"wow":4,"wowby":["furbiez-0-clock","snapdrag0ns","Spacey_boy","LegoManiac04"],"yay":1,"yayby":["Spacey_boy"],"sad":2,"sadby":["lesbiandragons","Spacey_boy"],"laugh":1,"laughby":["Spacey_boy"],"like":1,"likeby":["Spacey_boy"]}]
