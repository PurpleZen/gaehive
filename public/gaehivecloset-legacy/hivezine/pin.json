To put it simply, I hosted the backend for this site on Replit, which dealt with features like logging in, the Hivezine, and the host queue.  I have, however, been slowly migrating and remaking the Gaehive website to be better, cleaner, and to no longer rely on Replit. <b>Ver2 </b>of the Gaehive Website will release sometime in the first half of 2024 <sub><sup>(probably lol)</sup></sub> and will use Supabase for features like the Hivezine and host queue. I'll keep y'all updated on the Gaehive Studio!<br><br>To keep the legacy of this version alive, I have moved much of the stored data to a static, non-server, site, allowing for this site to be read-only!<br>You can find this version at <a href=\"https://gaehive-legacy.vercel.app/\">https://gaehive-legacy.vercel.app/</a>","id":152}]
