Since this is our first article, I&apos;ll give you an introduction. I&apos;m Lyran, and I use any pronouns except he/him. In this section, I will discuss everything related to VOCALOID.&lt;br&gt;Today, we will talk about a VOCALOID classic, &quot;The World is Mine.&quot; The song was written by ryo and sung by Hatsune Miku. It was released on May 31, 2008, and has become one of the most well-known VOCALOID songs.&lt;br&gt; The song is about a girl who calls herself a &quot;princess.&quot; She sings about her struggles in trying to get a boy to notice her. She wants him to give her everything she wants. At the end of the song, he pulls her out of the path of an oncoming vehicle, thus completing her struggle.&lt;br&gt;I hope you enjoyed my first ever Hivezine article!
