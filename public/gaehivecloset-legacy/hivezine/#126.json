Just a reminder that Scratch will be having &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/702112/&quot;&gt;downtime&lt;/a&gt; this weekend starting August 11th at 8PM ET, to August 13th at 11:59PM ET.&lt;br&gt;This means you likely will be unable to access Scratch during this time, as the site will be in maintenance mode.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you want to continue working on projects, you can download them and download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://scratch.mit.edu/download&quot;&gt;Scratch App&lt;/a&gt;,  though I would urge you all to take this as an opportunity to take a break! Though Scratch and the Gaehive is fun, please remember that it is important to take breaks from the internet and your screens! Here&apos;s some things you could do during the downtime:&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Go outside: Go for a walk, a hike, or just enjoy the outdoors! &lt;li&gt;Do art: Art can be really great for boosting your mental health, it&apos;s also just fun!&lt;li&gt;Read books: Reading also is great for your mental health!&lt;li&gt;Hang out: Hang out with some friends or family, do something fun together this weekend!&lt;/ul&gt;\nWant to share what you&apos;ll be doing this weekend or share ideas? Start a discussion in the Gaehive!&lt;br&gt;\nStay safe this weekend, and do something that&apos;ll make you feel good! :heart:","pid":231310493,"id":126,"sad":6,"sadby":["lesbian-lucifer","eve-mii","Prague_may23rd1618","dancinqq-","ARandomNumberIs7482","lesbiandragons"],"love":6,"loveby":["memorysauce","Prague_may23rd1618","ARandomNumberIs7482","livextreme4real","livextreme4real","Amazing_Enby"],"like":6,"likeby":["Ruby_Crystals","Prague_may23rd1618","ARandomNumberIs7482","-Lotus-Eater-","the-cxnnxmxn-rxll","ARCHlVED"],"wow":2,"wowby":["Anonymous_Triangle","eve-mii"]}]
